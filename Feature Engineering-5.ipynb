    "# Difference Between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding\n",
    "# Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are techniques used to convert categorical data into numerical data. While they may seem similar, they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ordinal Encoding\n",
    "# Ordinal Encoding is used for categorical data that has a meaningful order or ranking. It assigns integer values to categories based on their order. This encoding method is useful when the categorical variable has a clear, ordered relationship among its categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "# Consider a survey that asks respondents to rate their satisfaction on a scale: 'Poor', 'Fair', 'Good', 'Very Good', 'Excellent'.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Label Encoding\n",
    "# Label Encoding assigns integer values to categorical data without any intrinsic order. Each category is given a unique integer value. This method is generally used for nominal data, where the categories do not have a meaningful order.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "# Consider a dataset of animals with species names: 'Cat', 'Dog', 'Rabbit', 'Fish'.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#   When to Choose One Over the Other\n",
    "# When to Choose Ordinal Encoding\n",
    "# Ordered Categories: Use ordinal encoding when the categorical variable has an inherent order or ranking.\n",
    "# Example: Survey responses (e.g., 'Poor', 'Fair', 'Good', 'Very Good', 'Excellent'), educational levels (e.g., 'High School', 'Bachelor's', 'Master's', 'PhD').\n",
    "# When to Choose Label Encoding\n",
    "# Unordered Categories: Use label encoding when the categorical variable is nominal and does not have a meaningful order.\n",
    "# Example: Species names (e.g., 'Cat', 'Dog', 'Rabbit', 'Fish'), colors (e.g., 'Red', 'Blue', 'Green').\n",

    "# Target Guided Ordinal Encoding\n",
    "# Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables by sorting the categories according to the mean (or median) of the target variable. This method creates an ordinal relationship between the categories based on their relationship with the target variable, which can be particularly useful in supervised learning tasks.\n",

    "# Calculate the Mean (or Median) of the Target Variable for Each Category: For each category in the categorical variable, compute the mean (or median) of the target variable.\n",

    "# Assign Ordinal Values: Assign ordinal values to the categories based on the sorted order.\n",

    "# Predictive Power: When the categorical variable has a significant impact on the target variable, and you want to capture this relationship in the encoding.\n",
    "# High Cardinality: When dealing with high cardinality categorical variables where one-hot encoding would be impractical due to the large number of categories.\n",
    "# Example Scenario\n",
    "# Let's consider a scenario where you are working on a machine learning project to predict house prices. You have a categorical variable neighborhood and a continuous target variable price. \n",
